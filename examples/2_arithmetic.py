# ********************************************************************
# Numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, etc.
# This is done using what's called an operator, which defines
# an operation to perform on two values. The print() function is
# used in this program to output the results to the terminal.
#
# The most basic of these are the arithmetic operators which
# are used to perform arithmetic, such as addition and subraction.
# They generally follow ones used in standard math:
# "+" is used for addition
# "-" is used for subtraction
# "*" is used for multiplication
# "/" is used for division
#
# See if you can follow which lines of code in this program
# correspond to which lines of output in the console when the
# program is run. Remember, the lines are each run in order
# from top to bottom.

# ********************************************************************
# Numbers are added with the '+' operator. The values output
# by the print function is the result of that addition.
print("addition")
print(1 + 1)
print(4 + 2)
print(4.5 + 0.5)

# ********************************************************************
# Numbers are subtracted with the '-' operator. The values output
# by the print function is the result of that addition.
print()
print("subtraction")
print(1 - 1)
print(4 - 2)
print(4.5 - 0.5)

# ********************************************************************
# Numbers are multiplied with the '*' operator. So far, the operator
# has matched what you'd use normally, but since 'x' might be the
# name of a variable the programming language needs to use something
# different. See the `basic_variables.py` file for more.
#
# The value output by the print funtion is the result of that multiplication.
print()
print("multiplication")
print(1 * 1)
print(4 * 2)
print(4.5 * 0.5)

# ********************************************************************
# Numbers are divided with the '/' operator. The values output
# by the print function is the result of that addition.
print()
print("division")
print(1 / 1)
print(4 / 2)
print(4.5 / 0.5)

# ********************************************************************
# Multiple operations can be performed on one line, following the
# standard mathematical order of operations (Parenthesis, exponents,
# multiplication, division, addition, subtraction). What is the
# output of this line?
print()
print("complex equation")
print(1 + 2*(5*2 - 2)/4 + 1)

# ********************************************************************
# There's other operators, like '**' for exponents.
# This next line is 3 squared.
